# TwoSumCalculator

This code implements an algorithm to find pairs of numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. The algorithm assumes that the input array `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## Algorithm Explanation

1. Initialize an empty `results` list to store the pairs of numbers.
2. Set the `left` pointer to the first element of the array (`nums[0]`) and the `right` pointer to the last element (`nums[nums.length - 1]`).
3. Enter a loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right`.
4. Calculate the sum of the numbers at indices `left` and `right`: `sum = nums[left] + nums[right]`.
5. If the sum is equal to the target:
   - Add the pair `[nums[left], nums[right]]` to the `results` list.
   - Increment `left` by 1 to move to the next possible left element.
   - Decrement `right` by 1 to move to the next possible right element.
6. If the sum is less than the target, increment `left` by 1 to try a larger number.
7. If the sum is greater than the target, decrement `right` by 1 to try a smaller number.
8. Repeat steps until `left` becomes greater than or equal to `right`, indicating that all possible pairs have been checked.
9. Return the `results` list containing the pairs of numbers that sum up to the target.

## Note

The code assumes that the input array nums is sorted in ascending order. If the array is not sorted, the algorithm may produce incorrect results.
